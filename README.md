# OpenAI-Chatbot-with-Excel
### Langchain for Excel OpenAI is a system that combines the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model with Microsoft Excel to enable users to interact with Excel through natural language commands. The system uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to interpret user input and generate corresponding Excel commands, which are then executed in Excel. This allows users to perform tasks such as data analysis, visualization, and manipulation without the need for extensive knowledge of Excel functions and formulas.
